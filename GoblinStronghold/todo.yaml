keepInMind:
    - Performance doesn't matter until it matters.
    - Have the performance be shit and do things this simple way
    - Excessive iterations to find objects
    - Just query through the context

- turnSystem:
    - got turn system working
    - need to hook in player to it
    - do we maybe still need a "turn end" call back so its not blocking?

- dungonGeneration:
    - something basic
    - look at tutorials
- adventureLog:
    - multifonts?
    - how do components interact to make fun and surprising messages?
- diceRolling:
    - parse dice strings
    - be able to log some of them out? or how good an attack was
- yamlEntityConfig:
    - iterate over folders
    - some sort of manifest as we will no longer know the class at runtime
    - look at data-oriented-design?
    - type object pattern?
    - some sort of way of defining animations or appearance pools
    - dice roll health?
- input:
    - menus
    - keyboard control stack in manager

- globalConfig:

    - blocks sight
- ecsImprovements:
    - references? so we are not copying results constantly
    - properly db backed? maybe we can have fun doing it ourself with b-trees or something
    - an entity is just a search tree into the component store
- saves:
    - dump ECS contents? somehow? might be easier to do if its a db
