keepInMind:
    - Performance doesn't matter until it matters.
    - Have the performance be shit and do things this simple way
    - Excessive iterations to find objects
    - Just query through the context

    - iterate over folders
    - some sort of manifest as we will no longer know the class at runtime
    - look at data-oriented-design?
    - type object pattern?
    - some sort of way of defining animations or appearance pools
    - dice roll health?
- dungonGeneration:
    - something basic

    - an entity is just a search tree into the component store?
