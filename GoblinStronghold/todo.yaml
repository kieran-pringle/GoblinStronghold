keepInMind:
    - Performance doesn't matter until it matters.
    - Have the performance be shit and do things this simple way
    - Excessive iterations to find objects
    - Just query through the context
goals:
    - turn-based tactical squad loop: xcom
    - all moves have a time cost: running gets you further but wait longer for next turn
    - mouse control: easier navigation
    - lighting and fov
    - fun items that make a run worth it
    - classes
    - skill trees and leveling up
    - inter-run progression: unlock skill tree node permenantly? like sifu
    - better gear? gold earned usable on next run? or only if you get back?
    - what are the levels? what are the monsters?
    - elemental fighting: use right weapon against right monster
